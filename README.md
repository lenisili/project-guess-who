# Project Name

The goal of this project was to create the online version of the play "Guess Who" using mainly JavaScript.

## The problem

The main challenge this week was to make the JavaScript work. I frist struggeled to even display the board at the beginning. After I have figured that out and had an idea how the game should actually work, everything went quite quickly. It was a good way to get a deeper understanding of Array, Loops as well as objects.
